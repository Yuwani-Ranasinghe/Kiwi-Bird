        <h1>KIWI Bird ((Apteryx mantelli))</h1>
        <p><span>The word "kiwi" often brings to mind the image of something small, brown, 
            fuzzy, and found in the produce section</span> of your local supermarket. But the 
            kiwi is not a fruit—that's kiwifruit, which is native to eastern Asia! About the 
            size of a chicken, the kiwi is a small, flightless, and nearly wingless bird 
            found only in New Zealand</p>

                        <li><b>HABITAT AND DIET</b></li>
                            <p>The kiwi lives in forested areas of New Zealand that tend 
                                to be very steep and wet, surrounded by shrubs and trees 
                                found nowhere else on Earth. Since it is not able to fly up 
                                into trees to nest, rest, or escape from danger, the kiwi 
                                makes its home in burrows in the ground of its swampy 
                                forest or grassland habitat. The bird digs multiple burrows 
                                within its territory, using strong toes and claws. Nest 
                                burrows, dug early in the season, become overgrown at 
                                the entrance to provide great camouflage by the time the 
                                female is ready to lay her eggs.</p>
                        
                        <li><b>FAMILY LIFE</b></li>
                            <p>Kiwi pairs use gentle grunts and snuffles with each other 
                            and their chicks, and males purr during mating. Pairs do 
                            fight, and the larger female may kick the male away if she 
                            is not in the mood for his company. If another kiwi 
                            invades a pair’s territory, a kicking fight ensues, and kiwis 
                            have been known to fight to the death, although this is 
                            rare</p>
                            <p>An adult male and female kiwi typically pair for life, but a 
                                female may choose a new male if a more desirable one 
                                wanders by. The male doesn't have beautiful songs or 
                                fancy feathers to attract a female. Instead, he follows one 
                                around constantly while grunting. If she's not interested, 
                                the female might wander off or try to scare him away.
                                
                                Breeding season is late winter to early summer. Nests 
                                might be in hollow logs or in underground burrows dug 
                                by the mal</p>
                            <p>The female kiwi lays up to six eggs every year. Kiwi eggs 
                                are smooth and white, off-white, or pale green in color. 
                                They are also huge in comparison to the mother: one egg 
                                might reach up to 20 percent of her weight; that would 
                                be like a 120-pound (54 kilograms) human female giving 
                                birth to a 24-pound (11 kilograms) baby! Compared to 
                                the relative weights of other birds and their eggs, the 
                                female kiwi should weigh about 31 pounds (14 kilograms) 
                                rather than its typical weight of 2 to 8 pounds (0.9 to 3.6 
                                kilograms)</p>
